# Write a to perform arithmetic operations in Python:

num1 = float(input("Enter the 1st number :"))
num2 = float(input("Enter the 2nd number :"))

print(f"Addition of {num1} and {num2} is :", num1 + num2)
print(f"Subtraction of {num1} and {num2} is :", num1 - num2)
print(f"Multiplication of {num1} and {num2} is :", num1 * num2)
print(f"Division of {num1} and {num2} is :", num1 / num2)
